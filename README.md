# SaltyRPC

A simple RPC framework (.NET Core only), made for educational purposes and fun

This project uses :
- MQTT (Transportation Layer for RPC calls)
- RabbitMQ (Transport Layer for RPC calls)
- JSON (Serialisation of RPC Packets)

It was made for [SaltyEmu](https://github.com/BlowaXD/SaltyEmu) but discontinued because I can not put much time to have a cross langage RPC framework.
I want to use Go & C# on SaltyEmu which is not compatible with SaltyRPC.

# Contributing

I'm not willing to continue this project since I've learned what I wanted to learn.
